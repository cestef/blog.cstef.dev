I wrote my first real program at 12, on vacation in italy. my dad helped me sneak a raspberry pi and keyboard into our hotel room. I unplugged the tv, booted up the board, and followed some random ass tutorial on how to make a discord bot with javascript. the code was a mess. nothing worked right. I spent hours reading error messages I didn't understand, copying stack overflow answers I understood even less, and ~painfully~ slowly making progress. by the end of the weekend, I had something functional. it was a complete catastrophe (each command's event listener was a separate process), but hey, <span class="highlight"> it was mine!</span>

Fast forward to 2026. I'm lying in bed with my laptop, trying to figure out what to build next. nothing comes to mind, so I open mistral and ask for project ideas. I iterate over and over again. nothing clicks. I give up.

A few days later, I finally land on something worth building. I start scaffolding by hand, making decent progress. then I hit a wall—some bug I can't immediately solve, or a feature that needs research. my first instinct now? open the llm. ask it to fix the problem. let it write the solution.

I catch myself doing this even when I know I shouldn't. even when I know that figuring it out myself is the point.
here's the thing: I was always kind of a lazy guy. school never pushed me hard, I could get through with minimal effort, university is the same. I grew up in this "get rewarded for doing nothing" environment, and it warped how I approach everything, including programming. long-term effort feels pointless when shortcuts have always worked.

But I don't think llms created this problem in me. they just made it infinitely worse.

My generation might be the last one that learned [to code] without llms being a thing. we had to sit with confusion. we had to read documentation or articles that didn't make sense until suddenly it just magically did. we had to _earn_ our understanding through trial and error and frustration.

Now there are two paths: one where you struggle with a padlock until you figure out how to pick it, and one where the door just... opens. and yeah, that may sound a bit cheesy, but the point stands. when you can just bypass the struggle-part entirely, you never build the muscle memory of thinking through the problem yourself.

I see this in myself. I used to be able to sit with a bug/idea for hours, motivated and _somewhat_ focused. now my attention span has become catastrophic. why bother with something when I can paste it into a chat window and get an answer in seconds?

The "cruel" irony is that I know this is happening. I can see myself getting worse at the things I care about. and I still reach for the easy solutions anyway.
I don't think the answer is to pretend these tools don't exist. but I do think we're not talking/caring enough about what we're losing. that 12 year old me in the hotel room learned more in one weekend of frustration than I've learned in months of frictionless problem "solving".
